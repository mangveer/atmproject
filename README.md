Maximum PIN Attempts:

To enhance security, the system imposes a maximum limit on PIN attempts, preventing unauthorized access.
Transaction History:

The system maintains a record of balance history, capturing the account balance after each transaction.
Exception Handling:

The system gracefully handles exceptions, providing a seamless user experience and preventing abrupt program termination.
